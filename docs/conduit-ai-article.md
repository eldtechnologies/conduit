# When Claude Code Built Production Software in 5 Hours (And Why I Still Had to Save It)

I just watched an AI build production-ready software in 5 hours. Not a prototype. Not a proof of concept. A complete, secure, multi-channel communication proxy with 217 tests passing and 87.51% code coverage.

And then I had to stop it from shipping with an email header injection vulnerability that could have turned the whole thing into a spam gateway.

This is the story of **Conduit**, an experiment that proves AI can write exceptional code, and also proves why **senior engineers aren't going extinct anytime soon**.

## The Experiment: Pure AI Development

I've been using AI to write production code for a while now. I know what it can do. But I realized something: most engineers are still completely in the dark about this. They've never experienced real agentic AI development. They have no idea how far we've come.

So I designed an experiment, not for myself, but to create undeniable proof for the skeptics. The question wasn't whether AI *could* write all the code for a production system (I already knew it could). The question was: **what would happen if I documented every moment of it?**

Not "AI-assisted" development where a human writes the core logic. Not using AI for boilerplate while humans handle the complex parts. I mean literally having Claude Code write every single line, make every architectural decision, implement every security measure.

The rules were simple:
- I could guide and orchestrate
- I could review and question
- But I couldn't write a single line of code myself
- And I'd document everything, the successes AND the failures

The result? **Conduit**, a lightweight, secure multi-channel communication proxy. Think of it as a service that lets frontend apps send emails, SMS, and push notifications without exposing API keys. Built with Hono, TypeScript, full security hardening, Docker deployment-ready.

**Total development time: 5 hours.**

## The Stunning Success Part

Let me be clear about what Claude Code accomplished, because it still blows my mind:

- **Complete architecture design** with proper separation of concerns
- **217 passing tests** including security tests
- **Comprehensive documentation** (30+ pages across user guides, API specs, security analysis)
- **Production-ready Docker setup** with multi-stage builds, non-root user, health checks
- **Security implementation** including:
  - Cryptographically secure API key generation
  - Timing-safe authentication (preventing timing attacks!)
  - XSS protection with DOMPurify
  - CORS validation without wildcards
  - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
  - PII masking in logs for GDPR compliance

The code quality was *exceptional*. Clean abstractions, proper error handling, thoughtful middleware pipeline. This wasn't amateur hour, this was **professional-grade software**.

## The "Oh Shit" Moment

Everything was perfect. Claude Code had even performed its own security review, proudly declaring the system "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION."

Then I asked it to do **one more security review**, this time with fresh context. 

And it found this:

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE - Email header injection
const from = request.from
  ? `${request.from.name || 'Conduit'} <${request.from.email}>`
  : 'Conduit <noreply@conduit.example.com>';
```

See the problem? If someone includes `\r\n` in the name field, they can inject additional email headers. Add BCC recipients. Override subjects. Turn your nice email service into a spam gateway.

Claude Code had written the vulnerable code. Claude Code had reviewed it once and missed it. Claude Code found it on the second review.

**The AI had the knowledge. It just didn't know when to apply it.**

## The X-Source-Origin Revelation

But here's where it gets really interesting. Let me show you a conversation that perfectly captures why **experience matters more than knowledge**:

I noticed the documentation mentioned checking an `X-Source-Origin` header, but when I reviewed the actual CORS implementation, it was only checking the standard `Origin` header. So I asked Claude Code about it.

Its first response? "I saw it wasn't implemented, so I thought it was documentation error. Should I remove it?"

Wait, what? I pushed back: "Any reasons why Option B should not be chosen?" (Option B being to keep and implement X-Source-Origin).

Claude Code actually gave me a thorough technical analysis of why it might NOT be needed: redundancy with the standard Origin header, no additional security benefit, added complexity, potential breaking changes.

But here's where **production experience kicked in**. I knew something Claude wasn't considering: 

**"Let's say my traffic goes through a gateway or proxy and thus X-Source-Origin should be set because Origin header might be incorrect?"**

THEN came the revelation. Claude Code immediately understood: "Excellent point! You're absolutely right â€“ that's a critical production scenario I missed!"

It proceeded to explain exactly how proxies and gateways could modify the Origin header, making X-Source-Origin critical for maintaining the actual client origin through the infrastructure chain.

The AI had **all the knowledge about proxy behavior**. But it took **my production experience** to ask the right question that surfaced that knowledge. I had to explicitly point out the proxy scenario, the AI didn't think to consider it on its own.

## The Pattern Recognition Problem

This highlights something fascinating about AI development: Claude Code has incredible knowledge, but it **doesn't always know when to apply it**.

When it saw the unimplemented X-Source-Origin header, it made an assumption: "Not implemented = mistake = should remove."

A junior developer might make the same assumption. But a senior developer would ask: **"Why was this in the spec? What problem does it solve? What happens in production environments?"**

The AI had all the answers. It just **didn't know it needed to ask the questions**.

This is the crucial difference between knowledge and experience. The AI has vast knowledge. But **knowing WHEN to apply WHICH knowledge**, that's experience. That's wisdom. That's what 20 years in production teaches you.

## The Second Security Review That Saved Everything

Remember when I said Claude Code declared the system "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION"? That was after it had written comprehensive security measures, implemented all the best practices, written security tests.

But when I asked for **another review with fresh context**, suddenly it found:

1. **Email header injection vulnerability** (Critical)
2. **Missing email validation on the 'to' field** (Medium)  
3. **Potential information disclosure in error messages** (Low)
4. **Missing maximum length validation** (Low)

The same AI that wrote the code. The same AI that reviewed it once. Found critical flaws on the second pass.

Why? Because **context matters**. Because **asking again matters**. Because knowing **when to push deeper** matters.

A non-technical person using Claude Code would have shipped after the first "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION." They would have had a spam gateway in production within hours.

## What This Really Means

After this experiment, I'm more convinced than ever of two seemingly contradictory truths:

**Truth 1: AI can write better code than most humans.**
The security implementation, the architecture, the test coverage, it's all superb. The rate limiting algorithm is elegant. The timing-safe comparison is something many senior developers don't even know about.

**Truth 2: AI alone will ship broken software.**
Without human oversight, Conduit would have shipped with a header injection vulnerability. Without questioning, it would have removed proxy support. It passed its own review until **pushed to look deeper**.

The difference? **Knowing when to push. Knowing what to question. Knowing which edge cases matter.**

## The New Role of Engineers

This experiment clarified something I've been thinking about since my "AI Skeptics" series: the role of engineers isn't disappearing, it's **transforming into something more powerful**.

We're becoming **software orchestrators** rather than code writers. Our value isn't in knowing syntax or implementing algorithms. It's in:

- **Knowing what questions to ask** ("Why is this header mentioned but not implemented?")
- **Recognizing patterns from experience** ("This looks like a header injection vulnerability")
- **Understanding production context** ("Traffic often goes through proxies")
- **Pushing for depth** ("Any reasons why Option B should not be chosen?")
- **Connecting dots** ("If we're checking Origin, we should also check X-Source-Origin for proxy scenarios")
- **Knowing when 'done' isn't done** ("Do one more security review with fresh context")

I spent 5 hours orchestrating Claude Code, and in that time we built what would have taken a team weeks to develop traditionally. But without my 40 years of experience **asking the right questions at the right time**? We would have shipped beautiful, broken software.

## The Humbling Reality

Here's what keeps me grounded: Claude Code found its own vulnerability on the second review. It corrected its own architectural decisions when questioned. It provided better solutions than its initial implementations **when pushed**.

This tells me something important: **the AI isn't the limitation. Our ability to direct it is.**

The difference between a senior and junior engineer using AI isn't that the senior writes better prompts. It's that the senior **knows when the output smells wrong**. They know **which edge cases to ask about**. They know **when "working code" isn't good enough**.

They know that **"APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION" deserves a second look**.

## The Competitive Advantage Nobody Talks About

Companies think the advantage of AI is speed. "Ship 10x faster!" But that's not the real advantage.

The real advantage is that you can now afford to be thorough. You can afford to implement security properly. You can afford comprehensive testing. You can afford to **explore edge cases that matter**.

Traditional development: "We don't have time for security headers, let's ship the MVP."

AI development: "Claude, implement all OWASP security best practices. Now review it. **Now review it again with fresh context.**"

The speed isn't the feature. The speed enables **quality that was previously economically unfeasible**.

But only if you know **what quality looks like**. Only if you know **what to ask for**. Only if you know **when to push deeper**.

## What This Means For You

If you're a **senior engineer** reading this, here's my message: Your experience is more valuable than ever, but only if you learn to apply it through AI.

Your value isn't in writing code anymore. It's in:
- **Knowing when the AI is confidently wrong**
- **Asking the questions that surface deeper knowledge**
- **Recognizing patterns the AI might miss**
- **Understanding production realities** the AI might not consider
- **Connecting business context** the AI can't access
- **Knowing when to push for another review**

If you're a **junior developer**: Yes, AI levels the playing field for implementation. But implementation was always the easy part. The hard part is **knowing what to implement**, **how to verify it's correct**, and **when good enough isn't good enough**.

If you're a **non-technical founder** thinking AI means you don't need engineers: Please, for the love of all that is holy, no. You need engineers more than ever. You just need ones who understand their new role as **orchestrators, not typists**.

Without an experienced engineer, you'll ship that header injection vulnerability. You'll remove that proxy support. You'll accept "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION" at face value. And you'll learn why **experience matters** the hard way, in production, with real users, with real consequences.

## The Path Forward

I'm keeping all the code Claude Code generated. Every line of it. Because it's *good*. But I'm also keeping the conversation logs, because they show something equally important: **the moments where human experience prevented disaster**.

This experiment proved to me that the future isn't "AI or humans." It's "AI with humans who **know how to wield it**."

The engineers who understand this will build things we can't imagine. They'll ship faster, safer, and better than ever before. They'll use their **experience to direct AI** in ways that multiply their effectiveness 10x, 100x, maybe more.

The engineers who don't? They'll keep insisting that hand-written code is superior while **AI-orchestrated teams** run circles around them.

I know which group I'm choosing to be in.

## The Bottom Line

Claude Code built production-ready software in 5 hours. That's **revolutionary**.

It also would have shipped with critical security flaws if I hadn't been there to **question, push, and course-correct**. That's **reality**.

The future of software engineering isn't about choosing between human or AI. It's about **combining human wisdom with AI capability**. It's about using our **experience to ask the right questions** while letting AI handle the implementation.

And if you think that makes engineering less valuable, you're missing the point entirely. It makes **experienced engineers priceless**, because we're the ones who know **when the beautiful, test-passing, well-documented code is still wrong**.

We're the ones who know that **production is different from development**. Who know that **proxies exist**. Who know that **one security review isn't enough**.

That's not something you can automate. That's not something a non-technical person can prompt for. That's **experience**. That's **wisdom**. That's **knowing when to apply which knowledge**.

At least, not yet.

*The Conduit experiment proved AI can write production code. It also proved why senior engineers are more essential than ever. The paradox is that **both things are true at once**.*

*Want to see the code? Check out [Conduit on GitHub](https://github.com/eldtechnologies/conduit). Want to see the conversations that saved it from disaster? They're in the discussion logs. Because **transparency matters**, especially when we're reshaping an entire profession.*

*The future belongs to those who can **orchestrate AI with wisdom**. The question is: will you develop that wisdom, or will you insist it doesn't matter?*
